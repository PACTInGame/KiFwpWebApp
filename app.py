Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability and versatility.

## Basic Syntax

Python's syntax allows you to express concepts in fewer lines of code than would be possible in languages such as C++ or Java.

```python
# This is a simple Python program
print("Hello, World!")
Try running this code in your local environment!


Data Types in Python

Python has several built-in data types, including:



Numeric Types: int, float, complex

Sequence Types: list, tuple, range

Mapping Type: dict

Set Types: set, frozenset

Boolean Type: bool

Binary Types: bytes, bytearray, memoryview


Numeric Types

Integers

Integers are whole numbers without a fractional component.


x = 5
y = -10
z = 0

Floating-Point Numbers

Floating-point numbers, or floats, are numbers with a decimal point.


a = 3.14
b = -2.5
c = 0.0

Control Flow in Python

Python provides several ways to control the flow of a program:



Conditional statements (if, elif, else)

Loops (for, while)

Control statements (break, continue, pass)


Conditional Statements

Conditional statements are used to perform different actions based on different conditions.


x = 10

if x > 0:
    print("Positive")
elif x < 0:
    print("Negative")
else:
    print("Zero")

Try implementing a more complex conditional statement as an exercise!
